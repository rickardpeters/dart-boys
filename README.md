# Dart-boys

### Next.js
### Tailwind
### Firebase

I started this project as a fun side-project for my friends, who wanted a platform to keep track of their dart games and keep count of the friend group's best scores and who had won against who.

I decided to build the project in Next.js and Firebase to try out the development of a simple and easily deployable web app.
The project is still under development and aims to be finished in the spring of 2024.
